## JavaScript

- [gotql](https://github.com/khaosdoctor/gotql): gotql works like a transpiler, with a built-in HTTPRequest Client ([Got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got)), allowing you to write your GraphQL queries as objects instead of strings. | [Example](https://github.com/hasura/awesome-fluent-graphql/tree/master/example-gotql)

- [gqless](https://github.com/samdenty/gqless): With gqless, your queries are auto-generated at runtime! Using ES6 Proxies, gqless converts object property lookups into GraphQL queries. | [Example](https://github.com/hasura/awesome-fluent-graphql/tree/master/example-gqless-react)
- [graphql-typed-client](https://github.com/helios1138/graphql-typed-client): graphql-typed-client generates a strongly typed client library for any GraphQL endpoint.

- [typed-graphqlify](https://github.com/acro5piano/typed-graphqlify): typed-graphqlify lets you build typed GraphQL queries in TypeScript, and avoid redundancy of type definitions. | [Example](https://github.com/hasura/awesome-fluent-graphql/tree/master/example-typed-graphqlify)

# TypeScript

- [tql](https://github.com/timkendall/tql): Write type-safe GraphQL queries with TypeScript. | [Example](https://github.com/hasura/awesome-fluent-graphql/tree/master/example-tql)
